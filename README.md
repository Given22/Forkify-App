## General info
  
A cookbook, combined with Jonas Schmedtmann's API, contains recipes, namely the description of the dish and the necessary ingredients. The site uses local storage to save specific recipes and then show them in a separate list. Recipes are searched for by the phrase entered in the search engine. The layout was prepared by the creator of the course, it was up to me to add functionality.
